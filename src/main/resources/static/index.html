<p>So let's start by <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start">creating a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and logging in.</a><
    Now we're looking at the AWS Management Console home page.

    So right now we're logged in under our root account. This is, apparently, not a cute account to be managing our AWS resources with.
    For this reason, the first thing we're going to do is make an admin account and log in with it.

    In top navigation bar there's a searchbar. Type in 'IAM' and click the IAM button under Services.

    Find the 'Groups' button. It's located both in the left hand side navigation column and in the page's main content. Click that.
    Click the 'Create New Group' button. Name your group (ex: 'admins') and click 'Next Step'. The next page is titled Attach Policy.
    In this page there's table. That table has a search bar. Type 'admin' into that search bar. Click on the policy named 'AdministratorAccess'.
    Click 'Next Step' and then click 'Create Group'.

    Now we're back at the IAM main page. Find the 'Users' button. It's located both in the left hand side navigation column and in the page's main content. Click that.
    Click the 'Add user' button.

    Type in your name, and select both access type buttons (Programmatic access and AWS Management Console access).
    Follow your heart about whether you want to select 'Autogenerated password', 'custom password', and/or 'require password reset'.
    Definitely click 'Next: Permissions'.<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-2#/users$new?step=details"></a>

    The group you made a moment ago should be listed here. Add your user to that group. Then click 'Next: Tags'. Then
    click 'Next: Review'. Then click 'Create user'. Then stop.

    On your local machine, copy down your Access key ID, Secret access key, and password, being careful to also note which is which.
    Then copy the console link and paste it into a new browser tab. Because I went with defaults, for 'password' I'm using the password copied
    to my local machine a moment ago, and now I'm going through the create new password process, and now I'm logged in as myself with admin privileges.
